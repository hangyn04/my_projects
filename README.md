# [PROJECT 1: DATABASE PROJECT](https://github.com/hangyn04/my_projects/blob/main/Project%202.ipynb)
* I worked on this project as the real-world practice after learning the combination of MySQL and Python from my data manipulation course in my college
* While doing this project, I had a chance to learn about how to get data from excel file and use Python program for coding before inserting data into MySQL
* The project is a great starting level to apply what I was taught in class to real-world data practices. Therefore, I could fully understand the work responsibilities in the data industry in general
* Open this the excel file and import into csv file. Write Python code to insert all the data into the students table in the database

# [PROJECT 2: WORDLE CLONE GAME](https://github.com/hangyn04/my_projects_in_class/blob/main/Wordle%20Clone.py)
* This project is about the wordle game I made in my computer science class
* Download the game and play it to know the rules. Here are some rules I could figure out after playing games:
* A player only gets 6 guesses. For each guess, if the letter is correct and in the right spot, it will be drawn green
* If the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot, it will be drawn yellow
* If the letter is not in the word, the letter will be drawn blue
* A guess is good if it has exactly 5 letters, does not have duplicate letters, the present guess was not a past guess

# [PROJECT 3: DOES HIGHER MEAN BMI LEAD TO A HIGHER RISK OF STROKE?](https://github.com/hangyn04/my_projects_in_class/blob/main/Project%203.R)
* This project focuses on the risk of high BMI could negatively affect our health (higher risk of stroke)
* My team used R-studio to conduct hypothesis test, confidence interval, the linear regression plot. Here is the plot of BMI as a function of average glucose level: [plot](https://github.com/hangyn04/my_projects_in_class/blob/main/Project%203_Plot.png)
* Data report: [Project_3_Ha Nguyen_Karli Prather](https://github.com/hangyn04/my_projects_in_class/blob/main/DSC230_Project_3_Ha%20Nguyen_Karli%20Prather.pdf)

# [PROJECT 4: TRACK TIME TOOL](https://github.com/hangyn04/my_projects_in_class/blob/main/Track%20time.py)
* Designed a program that allows coaches to keep track of the personal records of athlete students
* The program should have these specifications: look up athlete's PR (personal record), add new athletes, remove graduated seniors, and update stored PRs
* This project is a great practice to help me work on csv file using Python in my computer science class
* In this project, I got data from [Track_time.txt](https://github.com/hangyn04/my_projects_in_class/blob/main/Track_time.txt)
