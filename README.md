# [PROJECT 1: DATABASE PROJECT] 
* I worked on this project as the real-world practice after learning the combination of MySQL and Python from my data manipulation course in my college
* While doing this project, I had a chance to learn about how to get data from excel file and use Python program for coding before inserting data into MySQL
* The project is a great starting level to apply what I was taught in class to real-world data practices. Therefore, I could fully understand the work responsibilities in the data industry in general
